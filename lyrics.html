        All my friends are heathens, take it slow
        Wait for them to ask you who you know
        Please don't make any sudden moves
        You don't know the half of the abuse

        All my friends are heathens, take it slow
        Wait for them to ask you who you know
        Please don't make any sudden moves
        You don't know the half of the abuse

        Welcome to the room of people
        Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
        Docked away
        Just because we check the guns at the door
        Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades

        You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
        You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you
        You'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"
        But after all I've said, please don't forget
        All my friends are heathens, take it slow
        Wait for them to ask you who you know

        Please don't make any sudden moves
        You don't know the half of the abuse
        We don't deal with outsiders very well
        They say newcomers have a certain smell
        You have trust issues, not to mention
        They say they can smell your intentions

        You'll never know the freak show sitting next to you
        You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
        You'll think "How did I get here, sitting next to you?"
        But after all I've said, please don't forget
        All my friends are heathens, take it slow
        Wait for them to ask you who you know

        Please don't make any sudden moves
        You don't know the half of the abuse
        All my friends are heathens, take it slow (watch it)
        Wait for them to ask you who you know (watch it)
        Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow (watch it)
        Wait for them to ask you who you know
        
        Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed
        I tried to warn you just to stay away
        And now they're outside ready to bust
        It looks like you might be one of us
